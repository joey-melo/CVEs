# CVE-2025-4876 â€“ Hardcoded Key Revealed in ConnectWise Password Encryption Utility

**Published:** 2025-05-19  
**Updated:** 2025-05-19  
**State:** PUBLISHED  
**Assigner:** ConnectWise  

## Description
ConnectWise-Password-Encryption-Utility.exe in ConnectWise Risk Assessment allows an attacker to extract a hardcoded AES decryption key via reverse engineering. This key is embedded in plaintext within the binary and used in cryptographic operations without dynamic key management. Once obtained, the key can be used to decrypt CSV input files used for authenticated network scanning.

## Affected Product
- **Vendor:** ConnectWise  
- **Product:** Risk Assessment  
- **Module:** connectwise-password-encryption-utlity.exe

- **Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N`  
- **Attack Vector:** Local  
- **Attack Complexity:** Low  
- **Privileges Required:** High  
- **User Interaction:** None  
- **Scope:** Changed

## Solution
ConnectWise deprecated the tool in July 2023 and provided a new utility that does not contain hardcoded keys. The previous tool relied on a third-party utility that required credentials to be stored locally to perform authenticated network scans. Partners who still have the deprecated tool on their systems should remove it.
